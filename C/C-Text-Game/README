February 2012

This was actually a game that my professor inspired me to make when I was
learning about Turing State Machines. He showed us a game where game states
were the same as Turing States and basically just looped around the states.
I followed that example and created my own game. No GUI.

This was actually a game I created for someone so I replaced some of the text,
just to take out the personal stuff.
