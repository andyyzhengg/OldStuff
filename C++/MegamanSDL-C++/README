June~July 2012

I was going to take a class in C++ in the fall so I tried learning C++ with 
some friends. However, they didn't stay for the fun, so I had to learn by myself. 
In order to motivate myself, I learned C++ with GUI's using the Allegro C++
GUI library. I even incorperated some networking into my code to make it
multiplayer. I never really finished this project so it's still incomplete.
But it had basic functionality! And I learned C++/Allegro/Winsocks!
