This project goes way back into high school. It was my final project for AP CS.
My friend, Aaron Cheng, and I wrote this to simulate the popular handheld pet
of the 90's. It turned out... well... By well I mean it did what we wanted.
Although functionality-wise we did expect more than just this. But we didn't
have much time! With finals and other APs to worry about I think we did pretty
well during the time. :)
